The web terminal is a **browser view of a tmux session**, reached through a link and
streamed over NATS. It lets you watch — and, as the operator, optionally steer — an agent
work without SSH access to the host, including agents running on remote/HPC machines.
Views are read-only by default; operators get a control-room index of all their sessions
and can opt into writable mode.

## How it works

Terminal bytes are ephemeral, so they travel over **core NATS, never JetStream**:

- **Gateway** — a Kubernetes service that serves the embedded xterm.js frontend and the
  WebSocket. It verifies the signed link, mints a short-lived grant, and bridges the
  browser to per-viewer NATS subjects in the requested vignoble's namespace. No inbound
  connection to the tmux host is needed. One gateway serves **all of your vignobles** (see
  [Multi-vignoble gateway](#multi-vignoble-gateway)).
- **Responder** — runs on every tmux host: in-process in the daemon on the Pinard host,
  and via `aoc webterm-responder` on standalone/HPC hosts. It verifies the gateway's
  grant (including the vignoble), then `tmux attach -r` (read-only) through an embedded
  PTY and streams frames back with flow control. It tears the PTY down on disconnect,
  idle, or target exit.
- **Signed links** — `…/sessions?v=<vignoble>&target=<target>&exp=<unix>&sig=<hmac>`,
  where the signature is an HMAC over the vignoble, target, and expiry. The vignoble is
  bound into the signature, so a link for one vignoble cannot be replayed against another.

## Getting a link

There are three ways to get a link:

```bash
aoc webterm-link --target <session> [--vignoble-name <v>]
```

`--vignoble-name` defaults to the resolved vignoble (`NATS_VIGNOBLE`); pass it explicitly
when generating links for a specific vignoble.

Add **`--auto`** to make the command suitable for automated callers: it prints nothing and
exits 0 when webterm or `post_links` is not configured, so scripts can invoke it
unconditionally and only append a link when one is returned.

From the conductor (régisseur/maître) TUI, the **`/webterm [name]`** slash command mints a
link for a vendangeur on demand — with no name it shows a picker of the active
vendangeurs.

Links can also be posted automatically onto MRs when `webterm.post_links: true`
(default off), once on first tracking. A link is only posted when a **real vendangeur
session** exists — tracking-only entries (e.g. `aoc track-mr` called without an active
worker) and cuvée MRs produce no link, because there is no live tmux session to stream:

- **With SSO enabled** — an **unsigned** link (`…/sessions?v=&target=`) is posted. It
  carries no bearer credential, so it's safe to advertise publicly: the gateway grants
  access only to the SSO-authenticated operator.
- **Without SSO (Phase 1)** — the link is the signed, expiring form (below).

### “Vendangeur attached” comment

When a vendangeur starts work it posts a **“🧰 Vendangeur attached”** note on the
driving issue/MR (session name, process, parcelle, run ID, start time). When
`webterm.post_links: true` the comment automatically appends a 🖥️ **Live terminal** link,
so reviewers can open the browser terminal immediately without generating a separate link.
This works even before `aoc track-mr` runs (i.e. before the MR is opened). The link
appears only when webterm is configured; if it is not, the comment posts as before without
the link.

## Multi-vignoble gateway

The gateway serves a **set** of vignobles rather than a single one. One deployed gateway
instance covers all of your vignobles — no redeploy when you add one.

The served set is determined as follows, in priority order:

1. **Explicit allowlist** — set `WEBTERM_VIGNOBLES` (comma-separated) on the gateway
   container, or configure `gateway.vignobles` in the Helm chart values. Only the listed
   vignobles are served; all others get a `403`.
2. **KV-derived (preferred, default)** — when `WEBTERM_VIGNOBLES` is unset or empty, the
   gateway serves any vignoble that has published an owner to the `pinard-vignobles` NATS
   KV. The daemon publishes on startup, so new vignobles appear automatically without a
   gateway redeploy; vignobles with no live daemon/responder simply return "session not
   found" when a viewer tries to connect.

Per request, the gateway reads `?v=<vignoble>` from the link, checks that the vignoble is
served, resolves the owner for that vignoble, and bridges the WebSocket to
`pinard.<vignoble>.webterm.*`. Operator authorization (`preferred_username` matching) is
also per-vignoble.

The responder verifies that a received grant is scoped to its own vignoble and silently
rejects grants intended for a different namespace.

## Authentication & authorization

With a `webterm.auth` block configured (Cognito issuer + client ID), the gateway runs the
OIDC login flow itself (Authorization Code + PKCE, public client), validates the ID token
against the pool's JWKS, and stores a stateless signed session cookie. Without it, access
is signed-link-only.

Authorization is deny-by-default:

- **Operator** (the vignoble owner, matched on the token's `preferred_username`) → any
  target in that vignoble; writable on request.
- **Capsule funder** (SSO-authenticated, matched to the worker's contract funder) → that
  one target, always read-only (steer toggle hidden).
- **Viewer** (a valid signed link) → that one target in that vignoble, read-only.
- Everyone else → denied.

Funder access is automatic: when a funded capsule worker starts, Pinard records the funder's
username in a NATS KV (`pinard-capsule-funders`). When the SSO-authenticated funder opens
the terminal URL, the gateway recognises them and grants read-only access without requiring
a separately issued signed link. They see a **🔒 capsule monitor (read-only)** indicator
and no steer toggle.

The owner is discovered automatically from a NATS KV published from `credentials.yaml`;
there's no manual user-to-vignoble mapping.

### Writable "steer"

Views are read-only by default. An **operator** (never a scoped-link viewer) can opt into
writable mode via a toggle in the terminal header (`?mode=rw`). The gateway mints a
writable grant only for an operator who requested it, forwards browser keystrokes, and the
responder attaches **without `-r`** and writes input to the PTY — single-writer, gated on
the grant at both ends, and audited as `mode=rw`. Anyone without the entitlement silently
falls back to read-only.

Toggling the steer mode requires a **full page reload**: the writability grant is minted
by the gateway at WebSocket upgrade time (based on `?mode=rw` in the URL). There is no
in-protocol way to upgrade or downgrade an existing connection without a new grant, so the
toggle triggers a reload rather than an inline switch.

## Terminal header features

The terminal header shows the vignoble name, the session target, and the current mode
(read-only / steer / capsule monitor). Two additional elements are present for every
viewer:

- **⛔ Interrupt button** — available to all viewers (read-only, steer, and funder).
  Clicking it sends an interrupt signal to the agent's NATS `…interrupt` subject
  (the same channel used by the conductor's `interrupt_worker` tool), cleanly cancelling
  the current turn without terminating the agent. This is safe because the signal goes
  through NATS, not a destructive `tmux send-keys C-c`.
- **Clickable issue link** — when the worker was spawned from a GitLab issue, a
  **📋 #N** link appears in the header pointing to the driving issue. The link is resolved
  from the worker's KV state (`PINARD_ISSUE_URL` set at spawn time).

## Control-room index

Opening the gateway with **no `target`** (`/sessions`) serves an authenticated,
**operator-only** two-pane control-room index:

- a **sidebar** of the vignobles you own, and
- for the selected vignoble, its **live** sessions — the régisseur, each maître window,
  and each vendangeur — enumerated over NATS in real time, each linking to a read-only
  terminal view.

Vendangeur rows are enriched with their parcelle and current state. **Remote agents**
(standalone/HPC workers not on the local tmux host) appear in the index as long as their
`lastSeen` timestamp is fresh (within 5 minutes). A vignoble with no live local responder
still shows any recently-active remote workers from the KV; it degrades gracefully rather
than erroring. Scoped (signed-link) viewers never see the index — it's operators only.

## Configuration

The `webterm:` block in `credentials.yaml` holds `base_url`, the link/grant/cookie
secrets, TTLs, `idle_timeout`, `max_viewers`, `post_links`, and the `auth:` sub-block
(`issuer`, `client_id`, `redirect_url`, `scopes`, `session_ttl`). A gateway needs the
link, grant, and cookie secrets; a responder needs only the grant secret.

For Helm deployments, the served vignoble set can be configured via `gateway.vignobles`
in the chart values (leave it empty to use KV-derived auto-discovery).

## Navigating windows without disturbing the operator

A **window** target (`session:window`, e.g. `conductor:3`) is viewed through a per-viewer
**grouped session**, so opening a régisseur or maître window doesn't move the operator's
active window; the grouped session is torn down with the viewer. Plain vendangeur sessions
attach directly.

## `aoc attach` — local terminal streaming

For operators on the Pinard host (or any machine with NATS access), `aoc attach`
provides a **direct local terminal view** without opening a browser:

```bash
aoc attach <session>               # stream by session name, agentId, or runId
aoc attach <session> --timeout 5m  # detach after 5 min idle
```

On **local sessions**, `aoc attach` starts an in-process PTY pump automatically,
so no separate `aoc webterm-responder` process is needed. For remote sessions, the
output is received over NATS (the remote host must be running a responder). Press
`Ctrl+C` to detach.

This is the CLI equivalent of the browser view — read-only, authenticated with
operator NATS credentials only (no SSO grant required).

## Known limitations

Terminal traffic currently shares one NATS connection (a dedicated account for terminal
traffic is a follow-up).
