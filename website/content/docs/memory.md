Agents are stateless across sessions. Without memory, every crash, every new
session, and every reaped worker throws away hard-won operational knowledge —
failure patterns, recovery recipes, threshold decisions — and a human re-teaches
the same lessons on every run. **Memory is how a Pinard fleet learns and improves
over time**, and it is the third pillar alongside the
[semi-deterministic loop](/docs/semi-deterministic-loop/) and the agents themselves.

Pinard's memory is **local-first, curated, and portable**:

- **local-first** — the store of record is local; cloud replication is best-effort
  and never blocks an agent;
- **curated** — signal over noise: agents write *distilled* observations (decisions,
  bugfixes, discoveries), not raw transcripts;
- **portable** — memory can be versioned and shipped *with* an agent (see the
  [layered architecture](/docs/memory-architecture/)).

## What runs today

### The wiki bundle

From Pinard v0.18 onward, the daemon seeds a `wiki/` directory inside the vignoble
on first start — an **OKF (Open Knowledge Format) bundle** that the memory service
then populates:

```
vignoble-<name>/
  wiki/
    index.md          # root index
    INSTRUCTIONS.md   # type vocabulary, folder conventions, contribution rules
    log.md            # change history
```

The scaffold is committed to the vignoble repo automatically. Subsequent content
comes from the [wiki curator](/docs/memory-curation/#the-self-evolving-wiki-) running
in the memory service pod, not from the daemon directly.

### The engram write path

Every vignoble has a memory backend called **engram**:

- **One store per vignoble** — a local database at `<vignoble>/.engram`, holding
  many projects.
- **A daemon-owned serve** — `aoc daemon` runs one `engram serve` per vignoble on a
  deterministic port; every agent attaches to it via `ENGRAM_URL`. Standalone remote
  workers, which have no daemon, run their own serve. The serve **outlives daemon
  restarts** so recall never gaps.
- **Cloud replication** — the daemon drains local writes to a central backend,
  best-effort, so memory survives host loss and can be shared. A **🧠 indicator** in
  the status line and `mem_doctor` report sync health.

### Role-scoped projects

Memory is separated by the **role** of the agent writing it, so a régisseur's estate
notes don't drown a worker's repo-specific knowledge:

| Role | Memory project |
|------|----------------|
| **Régisseur** | `vignoble-<name>` — estate-wide |
| **Maître** | `parcelle-<name>` — one workstream |
| **Vendangeur** | `<vigne>` — the bare repository name |

A useful consequence: because a vendangeur's project is just the repository name,
the **same repo worked in two different vignobles shares one memory project** — a
feature, not a leak.

## The memory protocol — what agents do

Agents follow a simple protocol that makes the fleet compound its knowledge.

### Recalling memory interactively (humans)

Operators can query and inject curated knowledge directly into an agent session
using the **`/recall`** slash command, available in both the conductor and vendangeur
interfaces:

```
/recall <query>                              # query mode — search across ALL curated scopes + Engram
/recall fetch wiki:<path>                    # fetch mode — retrieve full body of one wiki page
/recall fetch entity:<id>                   # fetch mode — retrieve full body of one entity
/recall --scope <name> <query>              # narrow to a specific SurrealDB scope
/recall --global <query>                    # query only the __global__ (cross-vignoble) scope
/recall --type <t> <query>                  # filter to a specific type (see type filter table below)
/lesson <text>                               # pin a durable rule/fact to shared memory
/lesson --edit                               # interactive picker — choose a lesson to edit
/lesson --edit --entity=<id>                # edit a specific lesson by entity id
/lesson --replace --entity=<id> <text>      # replace the text of a specific lesson
/forget --entity=<id>                       # delete a pinned lesson (confirmation required)
```

Pass `--type <t>` to narrow the fan-out to a specific result type:

| `--type` value | What it shows |
|----------------|---------------|
| `lesson` | Pinned lessons only (provenance = lesson) |
| `teaching` | Teaching-episode extractions only |
| `decision` / `artifact` / `diagnosis` | SurrealDB entities of that role |
| `wiki` | Wiki pages only |
| `engram` | Engram local observations only (skips SurrealDB) |

Without `--type`, `/recall` fans out to **both** sources across **all curated scopes**:
- **Curated knowledge** — SurrealDB wiki pages and typed entities searched across every
  vigne scope, the vignoble-wide scope, and the global scope simultaneously.
- **Engram local observations** — keyword/BM25 search in the vignoble's Engram store.

Use `--scope <name>` to narrow to one SurrealDB scope; `--global` limits to the
`__global__` cross-vignoble scope only. Without either flag, all scopes are queried.

In query mode you get an interactive pick-list of hits with source labels and refs;
select one or more entries to inject their full content into the current session context.
In fetch mode the full body of the referenced page or entity is injected directly.

This is the human parallel to the `recall` agent tool described below.

#### `/lesson` and `/forget`

Pin, edit, or delete durable rules and facts in shared memory:

```
/lesson always use a fix: or feat: commit prefix
/lesson --edit                              # pick an existing lesson and edit it interactively
/lesson --replace --entity=<id> <new text>  # overwrite a specific lesson
/forget --entity=<id>                       # delete a lesson (confirmation required)
```

A lesson is stored in the SurrealDB curated layer (not just Engram), injected into the
current session immediately, and surfaces in the boot manifest for future agents. Use
`/lesson` for high-value, long-lived facts — commit conventions, hard-won constraints,
canonical URLs. Entity ids appear in `/recall` hit labels and can be copied directly
into `--edit --entity=` or `--replace --entity=` flags.

See [Teaching & Curation](/docs/memory-curation/) for the full teaching
menu including `/teaching` mode.

### Reading memory (agents)

`recall` is the primary read tool for agents. It has two modes:

| Mode | How to invoke | What it does |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| **Query mode** | `recall(query="...")` | Fans out across **all curated SurrealDB scopes** (every vigne + vignoble + global) plus local Engram (keyword/BM25); returns source-labelled hits with inline refs. **Default.** Call when stuck, on failure, or starting a new subtask. |
| **Fetch mode** | `recall(fetch="wiki:<path>")` or `recall(fetch="entity:<id>")` | Exact drill-down: returns the **full body** of one wiki page or entity. Use when you have a `ref` from a boot manifest or from a recall hit. |

The two modes are mutually exclusive in one call.

#### Hit labels

Every hit returned by `recall` (and by `/recall`) carries a consistent label:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `[wiki · <scope>]` | Wiki page from the SurrealDB scope `<scope>` |
| `[lesson · <scope>]` | Pinned lesson entity |
| `[teaching · <scope>]` | Entity extracted from a teaching episode |
| `[entity:<role> · <scope>]` | Typed entity (role = `artifact`, `gotcha`, etc.) from SurrealDB scope `<scope>` |
| `[decision:mr · <scope>]` | Decision/artifact/diagnosis entity extracted from a merged MR (see [MR knowledge ingestion](/docs/memory-curation/#mr-knowledge-ingestion)) |
| `[engram:<type> · <engram-scope>]` | Engram observation of type `<type>`; `<engram-scope>` is Engram's own `project` or `personal` |

Curated hits also show a ref inline — e.g. `(ref: wiki:ops/singularity)` or
`(ref: entity:entity:abc123)`. Copy this ref and pass it to `recall(fetch=<ref>)` or
`/recall fetch <ref>` to drill into the full body.

#### No-result behavior

When no candidate is close enough to the query (all vector distances exceed the relevance
threshold), recall returns **nothing** rather than surfacing the nearest-but-irrelevant
hit. If you expect a result and get nothing, try a narrower or more specific query, or
switch to fetch mode with a known ref.

#### SurrealDB scope taxonomy

The curated knowledge base is split across independent scope databases:

| Scope | What it holds | Who writes |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| `<vigne>` (e.g. `genomics-workers`) | Per-repo worker knowledge — entities and wiki pages accumulated on that project | Workers spawned for that vigne |
| `vignoble-<name>` | Vignoble-wide rollup — promoted lessons, régisseur pins, cross-vigne facts | `/lesson` from the régisseur; the rollup promoter |
| `<name>` (bare vignoble name) | Régisseur's own Engram store (`project=<name>`) — régisseur's raw observations | `mem_save` from the conductor |
| `__global__` | Cross-vignoble shared knowledge — reusable patterns, canonical facts | Manual or cross-vignoble promotion |

By default, `recall` (both the tool and `/recall`) fans out across **all of these** —
every vigne scope, `vignoble-<name>`, the bare vignoble name, and `__global__` — so
results from worker knowledge bases are always visible to the régisseur without any
scope flag.

| Tool | What it searches | When to use |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| **`recall`** | All SurrealDB scopes + Engram (query mode) or exact ref (fetch mode) | **Default read tool** |
| **`mem_search`** | Local Engram observations only (semantic/natural-language) | Follow-up when `recall`'s Engram leg is thin and the query is conceptual. |
| **`mem_context`** | Local Engram (recent + project context) | Session warm-up. |

### Writing memory

- **`mem_save`** — capture a decision, bugfix, discovery, or convention the moment
  it happens (with a type and an optional stable `topic_key`).
- **`mem_session_summary`** — write a structured summary at the end of a session so
  the next agent inherits the context.
- **`mem_update`** — evolve a decision in place via its `topic_key` instead of
  piling up contradictions.

Supporting tools cover housekeeping and analysis: `mem_timeline`, `mem_get_observation`,
`mem_stats`, `mem_doctor`, and the relation-judgment tools `mem_judge` / `mem_compare`
(used by the promotion engine described in [Scope & Promotion](/docs/memory-curation/)).

## Boot injection at spawn

When a vendangeur starts, **before the first task**, the babysitter fetches a compact
knowledge index for the agent's scope from the memory service and injects it as
context. This means an agent inheriting a large vignoble can start a subtask already
aware of relevant decisions, gotchas, and wiki pages — without any manual recall
call.

The boot manifest is a **scope-grouped index**, not a dump of full content:

```
--- Knowledge index for your scope/task (use recall fetch=<ref> to expand) ---

[exo-cli]
  decision · Always use fix:/feat: prefix · Enforced by CI linter · wiki:exo-cli/commit-rules
  gotcha · Staging DB resets nightly · Never rely on its state across days · entity:gotcha:123

[vignoble-exohub]
  wiki · Cross-repo caching strategy · Shared guidance from the cuvee · wiki:_shared/caching

--- End of knowledge index ---
```

Each line is `type · title · one-line summary · ref`. The agent drills into any entry
with `recall(fetch=<ref>)` to get the full body. This two-step design keeps the boot
context small regardless of how much knowledge the vignoble has accumulated.

Boot injection is **fail-open** — if the memory service is unavailable or times out
(default: 6 seconds), the agent starts normally without a boot context.

## Operating memory

- The per-vignoble serve is **owned and supervised by the daemon**; it is started
  detached and left running across daemon restarts, so `mem_*` has no gap. An
  explicit `aoc daemon stop` tears it down; a `restart` or crash leaves it up.
- Check health with the **🧠 status-line indicator**, the engram section of
  `aoc status`, and **`mem_doctor`**.
- Cloud sync is **best-effort** — if replication is down, the local store is still
  the source of truth and agents keep working.
