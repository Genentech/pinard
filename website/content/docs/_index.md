## Orchestrate fleets of agents — reliably

Pinard is a **distributed engine for running fleets of LLM agents through
*semi-deterministic loops*** — deterministic runbooks that drive non-deterministic
agents, coordinated over NATS across many repositories and machines.

A raw agent is powerful but unpredictable: it wanders, forgets, and can't be
resumed. Pinard wraps every agent in a defined loop where the **control flow is
code** and only the **work inside a step** is left to the model. The result is agent
work that is **reliable** (the loop decides what happens next), **resumable** (every
step is journaled), **auditable** (you can read exactly what ran), and
**distributed** (loops run as a fleet across repos and machines).

Three pillars hold it up:

> **Deterministic control** · **Non-deterministic agents** · **Persistent memory**

Automating code review — turning issues into merged MRs — is just *one* built-in
loop. You write your own loops for whatever your fleet does, and the fleet gets
smarter over time as it writes what it learns to memory.

*One conductor. Many agents. One harvest.* 🍷

New here? Start with the **[Overview](/docs/overview/)**, then
**[The Semi-Deterministic Loop](/docs/semi-deterministic-loop/)** and
**[Memory & Recall](/docs/memory/)** — the ideas that make the rest cohere.
